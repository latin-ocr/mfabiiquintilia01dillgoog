119. 30. Barbarum, Grecomce. A proverbial
expression, used in reference to one who prononn·
ces Latin incorrectly, aa a foreignaeor Greek. ln
his first hook, § 16, our author eaya, “A boy
should not apply himself ao scrupulonaly to Greek
aa for a long tima to epeak no other tangue end
have no other study, as ie generally the caae 3 be·
cause euch a practice gives riae to greatfnulte in
our own pronunciation end language, both which

we contreet a habit of speaking in the Greek idinm,
it is almost irremovable‚ end gircea wrong turn to
our speaking of Latin. The atudy of the Latin
langnage ought therefore soon to follow that of the

together, and then by giving to both an equal tle-
gree of attention, neither will burt the other.”
